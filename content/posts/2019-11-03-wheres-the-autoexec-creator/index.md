You may have noticed the CS:GO autoexec creator is gone. It was written in PHP,
which cannot be run on the new site.  
I may create a new one in JavaScript, I may not. There are still plenty of
options on the web for creating and managing your CS:GO configuration.

Thanks for using the autoexec creator!
